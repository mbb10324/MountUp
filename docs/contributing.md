# Contributing to MountUp

Thank you for considering contributing to MountUp!

## Guidelines

### Reporting Bugs

-   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

-   Detail your suggestion in an issue. Explain the use case and why it would be useful to most react-onus users. Don't just tell what you want, but explain why.

-   Provide a clear use case. Your use case should be one that is beneficial to the wider community, not just something that you'd find useful.

-   Update the README.md with details of changes to the AddOn, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.

-   Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.

### Development Environment

Given the nature of MountUp being a AddOn for World of Warcraft, it is crucial to ensure that any changes made in the AddOn do not break features in the already included. Ensure you run and test any changes in a game environment.

### Code Style

Adhere to the existing coding style as much as possible. If in doubt, refer to popular style guides or the existing codebase.

### Getting Your Pull Request Merged

All Pull Requests are subject to approval by the repository maintainers. While not all Pull Requests may be merged, all are appreciated and will be reviewed quickly.

### Community

Keep all communication public. The community is valuable and public communication ensures that everyone can benefit from conversations, questions, and critiques.
