# Contributing to MountUp

Thank you for considering contributing to MountUp!

## Guidelines

### Reporting Bugs

-   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

-   Ensure your suggestion was not already made by searching on GitHub under Issues.

-   You can suggest enhancements in 1 of 2 ways:

    1. Create an issue on GitHub with the `enhancement` label.
    2. Fork the repository, create a branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

-   Detail your suggestion in an issue/pully. Explain the use case and why it would be useful to most MountUp users. Don't just tell what you want, but explain why.

-   Provide a clear use case. Your use case should be one that is beneficial to the wider community, not just something that you'd find useful.

-   If opening a pully; update the version number in the `MountUp.toc` file to the next appropriate version number utilizing semVer, and add a new entry to the `/docs/change-log.md` file with a bulleted summary of changes.

### Development Environment

Given the nature of MountUp being a AddOn for World of Warcraft, it is crucial to ensure that any changes made in the AddOn do not break features that the AddOn already provides, or within the game at large. Ensure you run and test any changes in a game environment.

### Code Style

Adhere to the existing coding style as much as possible. If in doubt, refer to popular style guides or the existing codebase.

### Getting Your Pull Request Merged

All Pull Requests are subject to approval by the repository maintainers. While not all Pull Requests may be merged, all are appreciated and will be reviewed quickly.

### Community

Keep all communication public. The community is valuable and public communication ensures that everyone can benefit from conversations, questions, and critiques.
